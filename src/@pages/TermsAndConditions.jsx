        integration, data import and export, monitoring, technical support, maintenance,
        training, backup and recovery (“Professional Services” together with Subscription
        Services, the “Services”) related to Customer’s access to, and use of, such
        Subscription Services and the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services; Access and Use License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, during the Term, Physna shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
        provide Customer and authorized users access to the Services and the Platform.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the term of this
        Agreement Physna grants Customer a personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable,
        nontransferable, worldwide license to use the Platform, solely for Customer’s
        internal business purposes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subscription Services. Each applicable Order Form shall specify the Subscription
        Services to be provided in accordance with the representations and warranties set
        forth in this Agreement, and shall identify the Platform, fees, subscription term,
        and other applicable terms and conditions. Changes to Platform. Physna may make,
        in its sole discretion, any changes to the Platform that it deems necessary or
        useful (i) to maintain or enhance the quality or delivery of the Services, the
        competitive strength of, or market for, Physna’s products or services, or the
        Platform’s cost efficiency or performance, or (ii) to comply with applicable law.
        platform access
      </p>
      <p>
        Administrative Users. During the configuration and set-up process for the
        Platform, Customer will identify an administrative user name and password for
        Customer’s Thangs™ account. Physna reserves the right to refuse registration of or
        cancel user names and passwords it deems inappropriate. Authorized Users. Customer
        may allow such number of Customer’s employees and/or independent contractors as
        indicated on the Order Form to use the Platform on behalf of Customer as
        “Authorized Users.” Authorized User subscriptions are for designated persons and
        shall not be shared or used by more than one Authorized User, but may be
        reassigned to new Authorized Users replacing former Authorized Users who on longer
        require ongoing use of the Platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Authorized User Conditions to Use. As a condition to access and use of a Platform,
        each Authorized User shall abide by the terms of this Agreement. Customer shall
        ensure compliance by each Authorized User. Customer shall immediately notify
        Physna of any violation of the terms of this Agreement upon becoming aware of such
        violation, and shall be liable for any breach by any Authorized User.
      </p>
      <p>
        Account Responsibility. Customer will be responsible for (i) all uses of any
        account that Customer has access to, regardless of whether the Customer has
        authorized the particular user and regardless of Customer’s knowledge of such use,
        and (ii) securing its Physna account, passwords (both administrative and user
        passwords) and files. Physna is not responsible for any losses, damages, costs,
        expenses, or claims that result from lost or stolen passwords.
      </p>
      <p>Machine Learning Models – Access and Ownership</p>

      <p>
        Access. Customer may use the Platform to develop models that simulate human
        intelligence by a computer (“Artificial Intelligence” or “AI”) and perform a
        computer system’s scientific study of algorithms and statistical models whereby
        the computer system performs a specific task on the basis of pattern and inference
        rather than specific instructions (“Machine Learning”). Each algorithm used in
        Machine Learning that helps the computer imitate the process(es) by which a human
        being learns shall be a “Learning Algorithm.” Ownership. In developing any Machine
        Learning model, Customer shall abide by all applicable laws, regulations, and
        protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        All Machine Learning models, including any Learning Algorithm, developed in whole
        or in part by way of the Platform shall remain the sole property of Physna.
      </p>

      <p>
        All output training parameters generated by a Machine Learning model developed in
        whole or in part on the Platform shall remain the sole property of Physna.
      </p>

      <p>
        All input data, output data, and output training parameters supplied by Customer
        and not developed by a Machine Learning model shall remain the sole property of
        Customer. However, Physna shall have full access to the model’s input data and
        output data for as long as the model exists. Physna may use such data in any
        future deployment of AI by Physna by way of the Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customer agrees to maintain, during the term of this Agreement and for two (2)
        years after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, complete and accurate
        records of all Machine Learning models (including information on model drift and
        retraining), input data, and output data developed or generated under this
        Agreement. Physna may, at its own expense, on reasonable prior notice to Customer,
        inspect and audit Customer’s records of such information.
      </p>

      <h4>ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
      <p>

        Confidential Information. Each party (the “Receiving Party”) understands that the
        other party (the “Disclosing Party”) has been, and may be, exposed to or acquired
        business, technical or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s
        business (hereinafter referred to as “Confidential Information”). Confidential
        Information of Physna includes non-public information regarding features,
        functionality and performance of the Platform and the Software. Confidential
        Information of Customer includes non-public data provided by Customer to Physna to

        explicitly excludes all Machine Learning models and Learning Algorithms. The terms
        and conditions of this Agreement, including all pricing and related metrics, are
        Physna’s Confidential Information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
        Confidential Information shall not include any information that the Receiving
        Party can document (i) is or becomes generally available to the public, (ii) was
        in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, (iii)
        was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (iv) was
        independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the
        Disclosing Party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-use and Non-disclosure. With respect to Confidential Information of the
        Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party agrees to: (i) use the same degree of care
        to protect the confidentiality, and prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure, of
        such Confidential Information it uses to protect its own proprietary and
        confidential information of like nature, which shall not be less than a reasonable
        degree of care, (ii) hold all such Confidential Information in strict confidence
        and not use, sell, copy, transfer reproduce, or divulge such Confidential
        Information to any third party, (iii) not use such Confidential Information for
        any purposes whatsoever other than the performance of, or as otherwise authorized
        by, this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding Section 6.3, the Receiving Party may
        disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent necessary
        to comply with a court order or applicable law; provided, however that the
        Receiving Party delivers reasonable advance notice of such disclosure to the
        Disclosing Party and uses reasonable efforts to secure confidential treatment of
        such Confidential Information, in whole or in part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remedies for Breach of Obligation of Confidentiality. The Receiving Party
        acknowledges that breach of its obligation of confidentiality may cause
        irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which the Disclosing Party may not be
        fully or adequately compensated by recovery of monetary damages. Accordingly, in
        the event of any violation, or threatened violation, by the Receiving Party of its
        obligations under this Section, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek
        injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in addition to any other
        remedy that may be available at law or in equity, without the necessity of posting
        bond or proving actual damages.

      <h4>Term AND TERMINATION</h4>
      <p>
        Term. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and will terminate upon 60

        with this Section 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Termination for Default. Failure by either party to comply with any material term
        or condition of this Agreement shall constitute default. The nondefaulting party
        shall be entitled to give written notice to the defaulting party requiring it to
        cure the default. The notice shall include a detailed description of the act or
        omission that constitutes default. If the defaulting party has not cured the
        default within 30 days after receipt of the notice, the nondefaulting party may
        terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to take effect upon receipt. The
        right to terminate this Agreement is in addition to any other rights and remedies
        provided under this Agreement or otherwise under law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional Right. In addition to the rights set forth in Section 7.2 above, if
        Customer fails to pay any fees or charges due under this Agreement or fails to
        carry out any other material obligation under this Agreement, Physna may, at its
        option, suspend access to the Platform, upon ten days&apos; prior written notice
        to Customer, until Customer cures the default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effect of Termination. No termination of this Agreement shall release Customer
        from any obligation to pay Physna any amount that has accrued or becomes payable
        at or prior to the date of termination. No suspension of access to the Platform
        shall release Customer from any obligation to pay Physna any fees due under this
        Agreement. Customer shall not be entitled to any refund of any fees paid to Physna
        as a result of any termination of this Agreement, except to the extent access to
        the Platform has not yet begun.
      </p>
      <p>fees and Payment Terms</p>
      <p>
        Fee. Customer will pay Periscope the then-applicable fees described in the Order
        Form, in accordance with the terms set forth therein (“Fees”), including, for the
        avoidance of doubt, any fees incurred through Customer’s use of the Platform
        exceeding a services capacity parameter specified on an Order Form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment. Physna may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment
        for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Physna thirty (30) days
        after the mailing date of the invoice (unless otherwise specified on the
        applicable Order Form). Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per
        month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
        lower, plus all expenses of collection. In addition to any other remedies
        available, Physna may suspend Services in the event of payment delinquency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment Disputes. If Customer believes that Physna has billed Customer
        incorrectly, Customer must contact Physna no later than thirty (30) days after the
        closing date on the first billing statement in which the believed error or problem
        appeared in order to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed
        to Physna’s billing department.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taxes. Customer shall pay when due or, if necessary, reimburse Physna for, all
        sales, use, property, excise, and other similar taxes, including penalties and
        interest arising from Customer&apos;s failure to pay such taxes timely, resulting
        from any activities under this Agreement, exclusive of taxes based on
        Physna&apos;s net income or corporate franchise. If Customer has tax exempt
        status, it shall supply Physna with its tax-exempt certificate and/or number as
        necessary. Taxes are due as assessed.
      </p>
      <h4>WARRANTIES</h4>

      <p>
        Limitation of Liability. The total cumulative liability of Physna for all claims,
